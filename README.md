I have download the pre-trained model from google drive and upload to baiduyun

*Attention*: the model file has a little problem with my opencv. My opencv can not recognize the yaml file and treat it as xml file because the first line is not correct. If you have the same problem, please revise the first line of the model file like the two images in baidunyun link. (The file is too large, you can use vim to open it. Notepad and Notepad++ can not open it)
